# Background

Talk about 8078 and 7344.
Some Registrars may support CDS even if the Registry does not.
Some Registries may use EPP as the method by which CDS signals are applied to the registry service.
This document seeks to map the three use cases found in RFC 8078 section 2, to EPP operations.

# Use Cases
## Enable DNSSEC Validation

## Roll over the KSK

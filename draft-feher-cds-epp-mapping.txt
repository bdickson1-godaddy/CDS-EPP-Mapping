1.  Introduction

   TODO Introduction

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Background

   [RFC7344] specifies how DNS trust can be maintained across key
   rollovers in-band between parent and child.  [RFC8078] added inband
   signalling DNSSEC status changes and documented 3 use cases.  This
   document describes how the parent zone changes required by those use
   cases might be implemented via EPP.  This document seeks to map the
   three use cases found in [RFC8078] section 2, to EPP operations.

3.1.  Registries and Registrars

   Support for CDS/CDNSKEY amongst Internet Registries is likely to
   remain inconsistent for some time.  Therefore practices for updating
   the parent zone for a registered domain should allow for either the
   Registry or the sponsoring Registrar to observe a domain's CDS

   records and subsequent state changes.  In most TLDs both the
   Registrar and Registry are capable of making the changes signaled by
   CDS records, to the parent zone.

   Some Registrars may support CDS even if the Registry does not.

   Some Registries may use EPP as the method by which CDS signals are
   applied to the registry system for subsequent entry into the
   registered domain's parent zone.

4.  Registrar Initial Trust Models

   RFC8078 proposes several models that a parent may use for managing
   initial trust.  These models assume that it is the parent which will
   observe any CDS/CDNSKEY signals and it will also be the parent which
   manages the initial trust solution.

   When a Registry does not support [RFC8078] a Registrar can instead
   carry out the operations described in [RFC8078] section 3.

4.1.  Accept Policy via Authenticated Channel

   The Registrar can use an authenticated channel to receive a notice
   that a CDS/CDNSKEY exists.  Once the notice is received, the process
   documented in [RFC8078] section 3.1 should be followed.

4.2.  Accept with Extra Checks

   TODO

4.3.  Accept after Delay

   TODO

4.4.  Accept with Challenge

4.5.  Accept from Inception

   TODO # EPP Commands for CDS/CDNSKEY Use Cases

4.6.  Enable DNSSEC Validation

   Regardless of the method used to determine that the initial CDS/
   CDNSKEY signal is trustworthy, the Registrar or Registry SHOULD use
   the EPP <update> command with the secDNS extension documented in
   [RFC5910] in order to add the DS to the parent.  A <secDNS:add> sub-

   element to <secDNS:update> MUST be used to indicate that security
   information is being added.  In the case of a CDS RRset the DS Data
   Interface MUST be used by including the <secDNS:dsData> child element
   to <secDNS:update>.  In the case of a CDNSKEY RRset, the Key Data
   Interface MUST be used by including the <secDNS:keyData> child
   element to <secDNS:update>.  If both CDS and CDNSKEY RRsets are
   present then a Registrar SHOULD choose the RRset based on the server
   policy.

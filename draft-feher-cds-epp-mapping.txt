1.  Introduction

   TODO Introduction

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Background

   RFC 7344 specifies how DNS trust can be maintained across key
   rollovers in-band between parent and child.  RFC 8078 added inband
   signalling DNSSEC status changes and documented 3 use cases.  This
   document describes how the parent zone changes required by those use
   cases might be implemented via EPP.  This document seeks to map the
   three use cases found in RFC 8078 section 2, to EPP operations.

3.1.  Registries and Registrars

   Support for CDS/CDNSKEY amongst Internet Registries is likely to
   remain inconsistent for some time.  Therefore practices for updating
   the parent zone for a registered domain should allow for either the
   Registry or the sponsoring Registrar to observe a domain's CDS

   records and subsequent state changes.  In most TLDs both the
   Registrar and Registry are capable of making the changes signaled by
   CDS records, to the parent zone.

   Some Registrars may support CDS even if the Registry does not.

   Some Registries may use EPP as the method by which CDS signals are
   applied to the registry system for subsequent entry into the
   registered domain's parent zone.
